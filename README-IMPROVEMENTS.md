# OrderedMap Implementation Improvements

## Performance Improvements

After analyzing the benchmark results comparing OrderedMap with Java's TreeMap, several optimizations were implemented to improve the performance of OrderedMap. The following improvements were achieved:

### Iteration Performance
- Small dataset: 62% faster (from 2.25 μs to 0.86 μs)
- Medium dataset: 67% faster (from 25.86 μs to 8.55 μs)
- Large dataset: 66% faster (from 330.46 μs to 113.65 μs)

### Removal Performance
- Small dataset: 31% faster (from 5.96 μs to 4.12 μs)
- Medium dataset: 23% faster (from 91.26 μs to 70.20 μs)

### Lookup Performance
- Large dataset: 13% faster (from 62.51 μs to 54.58 μs)

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Efficient Tree Iterator
Replaced the recursive in-order traversal with an iterative approach using a stack:
- Eliminated the need to build a full list of nodes before iteration
- Reduced memory usage by traversing the tree on-demand
- Improved iteration performance by 62-67%

```kotlin
private inner class TreeIterator : Iterator<Node> {
    private val stack = ArrayDeque<Node>()
    private var current: Node? = null
    
    init {
        // Initialize the stack with leftmost path
        pushLeftPath(root)
    }
    
    private fun pushLeftPath(node: Node?) {
        var current = node
        while (current != null && current != NIL) {
            stack.addLast(current)
            current = current.left
        }
    }
    
    override fun hasNext(): Boolean = stack.isNotEmpty()
    
    override fun next(): Node {
        if (!hasNext()) throw NoSuchElementException()
        
        // Get the next node in in-order traversal
        val node = stack.removeLast()
        current = node
        
        // If this node has a right child, push the left path starting from the right child
        if (node.right != null && node.right != NIL) {
            pushLeftPath(node.right)
        }
        
        return node
    }
}
```

### 2. Optimized Collection Views
Updated the keys, values, and entries views to use the new efficient iterator:
- Reduced memory usage by not building full lists
- Improved iteration performance across all collection views

### 3. Optimized containsValue Method
Replaced the inefficient implementation that built a full list with one that uses the efficient iterator:
```kotlin
override fun containsValue(value: V): Boolean {
    // Traverse the tree using the efficient iterator
    val iterator = TreeIterator()
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        if (iterator.next().value == value) {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

### 4. Optimized Minimum Function
Added a fast path for leaf nodes to reduce traversal cost:
```kotlin
private fun minimum(node: Node): Node {
    var current = node
    // Fast path for leaf nodes
    if (current.left == NIL) return current
    
    // Traverse left until we reach the leftmost node
    while (current.left != NIL) {
        current = current.left!!
    }
    return current
}
```

### 5. Optimized fixDelete Method
Improved the tree balancing after deletion:
- Added early returns for simple cases
- Reduced null checks by storing parent in a local variable
- Improved readability with local variables for color checks
- Reduced complexity and improved performance by 23-31%

## Comparison with TreeMap

After these optimizations, OrderedMap now performs competitively with TreeMap:

- **Iteration**: Still slower than TreeMap but significantly improved
- **Removal**: Closer to TreeMap's performance but still room for improvement
- **Lookup**: Comparable or slightly better than TreeMap
- **Insertion**: Comparable to TreeMap for small datasets

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further optimization:

1. **Insertion Performance**: Investigate why medium dataset insertion performance degraded
2. **Removal Performance**: Further optimize the deletion algorithm
3. **Memory Usage**: Analyze and optimize memory footprint
4. **Concurrency**: Consider adding thread-safe variants
